##  **" Anomaly Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using IEEE CIS dataset"**
For this project we went through a plethora of online datasets, publicly available models, and various off domain model architecture that would be a fit for this task.
Some of the datasets that we taken into consideration were:
  * [Financial Anomaly Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devondev/financial-anomaly-data)
  * [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
  * [Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)
  * [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)

The the dataset that we used here is [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data).

### Reasons for using this Dataset
  * Detailed MetaData
  * Highly inuvitive feature data and explainations from
  * Real world data (not synthetic as it has certain features encoded to protect privacy, just sounded cooler than synthetic data)
  * Large number of datasets used for increased efficiency
    
Further details about the dataset and code implememntation are as mentioned above.
